# AdventureGame
A small C# console game I'm writing over the course of 2018. Will try to do 5+ updates a week.

[Changelog 1/1/2018]
- Added very archaic title screen.
- Made a very simple character creator.
  - Choose first name, last name, race, and profession. Race will determine your final stats. Profession will tweak your stats even finer and provide hidden bonuses (e.g. Thief profession has a lower chance to be found in a sneak scenario, etc.)
- Added character review + confirmation.

What's coming?
- Enemy encounters
- More variables!
- Detailed descriptions; world building
